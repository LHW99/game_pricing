## Steamdb CSV Reader

This is a .csv reader program written in python.

It's meant to read .csv files from steamdb.info, a site that has the price history of video games on the Steam platform.

Using this program, you can open a .csv file and it will provide information such as sales history and a visual representation. 

Comes loaded with some dummy data so you can give it a try.
